# Introduction-of-Computer-Vision
Tasks:
1.   How can you improve the visual qualilty of a noisy image. What are the limitations of each   technique used.
 
2.	  Can you detect the prominent circular/ oval objects from an image. What are the limitations of each technique used.
3.	  Can you detect where one color ends and the next one starts. Alternatively is it possible to detect the number of colors used. If possible where will each technique break          down.
     Is it possible to extract/crop the different objects based on color information alone.
 

4.   Can you detect the boundaries of the objects represented in the images. If so what can make the task easier or more difficult.
     How far can you scale the technique, high resolution, fine grain edges etc.
     How about edges other than horizontal and vertical ones.
